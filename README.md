# World Headlines App

This is a front-end React project making use of the https://newsapi.org/ API to fetch the top headlines per Country and Category.

## Usage

Clone the repository and `cd` to its directory. Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed and run `npm install`, this will add all the necessary dependencies.
You will need a NewsAPI API Key for the GET requests in this application. With one at hand, simply rename the file named `.env_example` to `.env` and replace the placeholder text in it for your API key.
With this ready, run the `npm start` command for the application to run in your local environment.
