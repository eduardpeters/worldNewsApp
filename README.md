# World Headlines App

This is a front-end React project making use of the https://newsapi.org/ API to fetch the top headlines per Country and Category and the https://openweathermap.org/ API to fetch the current weather in the selected country's capital.

## Usage

Clone the repository and `cd` to its directory. Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed and run `npm install`, this will add all the necessary dependencies.
You will need both NewsAPI and OpenWeather API Keys for the GET requests in this application. With those in hand, simply rename the file named `.env_example` to `.env` and replace the placeholder text in it for your API keys.
With this ready, run the `npm start` command for the application to run in your local environment.
